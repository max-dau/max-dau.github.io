                I pretty much built this website just because I was bored. I don't expect anyone, especially not any more than 10 persons to visit this page in it's entire lifetime.
                I started to learn to do HTML one or two years ago, but I stopped because I didn't have anything exact which I could make, meaning that I lost the motivation. So now, I have my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfXjU9qLtGZ9EM5nQwjIWw">YouTube channel</a> and have started to really enjoy making videos, streaming, graphic design, etc.. Now, I had the idea of building a website for my channel. At first, i wanted to build it with Squarespace or some similar service, but I decided that I could start doing it from scratch with HTML and graphic design, because I in general don't like using templates, especially because I learned to graphic design and learned the very basics of HTML and webdesign and so I have the ability to make a site which I can call my own, unique site, also when it is far away from the perfect webpage. So this site will probably never be totally finished, I (at least hope) that I will keep working on it and improving it in at least the near future.
